Data scientists can use the best of open source, tap into IBM's unique features, grow their skills, and collaborate with teams. \nOne of the many features of Watson Studio provides the capability to create and train a machine learning model in Watson Studio with little to no coding. This model can subsequently be saved and deployed to Watson Machine Learning on IBM Cloud and called for scoring in real-time. \nThis tutorial is a continuation of the logistic regression analysis tutorial at: \nhttps://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-example-log-regress.html \nwhich creates, trains, saves and deploys a logistic regression model that predicts the possibility for a tent purchase based on age, sex, marital status and job profession for an individual. In this tutorial, a very simple Python Flask web application front end will be created to call this deployed model in real time. \n\n## Table of contents\n\n1.

Test model access by using a notebook. \n\nThe first part of this notebook will confirm that the deployed model can be accessed via an external API. Please note that the credentials and endpoint used in this tutorial are only examples. You must substitute your own credentials and endpoint values. \n\n<a id=\"test1\"></a>\n### 1.1 Prerequisites.\n\nThis notebook and the corresponding tutorial sections require several IBM Cloud services. \n\n- An Apache Spark instance which was created with your Watson Studio account\n- An Object Storage instance which was also created with your Watson Studio account\n- An IBM Watson Machine Learning instance which will need to be created\n- A Python Flask instance which will be created later as part of this tutorial\n\nFor more information about setting up your machine learning service, see [Setting up your machine learning environment](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-setup.html).\n\n<a id=\"test2\"></a>\n### 1.2 Retrieve your credentials.\n\nTo run the code samples in this notebook, you must supply information, such as the URL, username, password, and scoring endpoint variables from your environment. The details on how to do this are described in the following steps:\n\n1. Log in to your **IBM Cloud** account and, from the dashboard, select the **IBM Watson Machine Learning** service that you created.\n2. Click **Service credentials**.\n3. Click **View credentials** and then copy the values from the **URL**, **username**, and **password** fields to the corresponding `URL`, `username`, and `password` variables in the code cells in this notebook. \n4. To find the scoring endpoint, log in to **Watson Studio**.\n5. Click **Projects** and from the list, click your project.\n6. On the **Assets** tab, in the **Models** section, click the model.\n7. In the **Deployments** section, click the model deployment and then, on the **Details** tab, copy the  **Scoring End Point** and paste it into the `scoring_endpoint` variable in this notebook.\n\n<a id=\"test3\"></a>\n### 1.3 Authenticate and import libraries.\n\nAfter you update the following code cells with your specific information, you are ready to run the cells. Run the following cell to define your credentials to the Watson Machine Learning service and to import necessary libraries.",

This confirms that the deployed machine learning model can be called by using an API. \n\n<a id=\"create\"></a>\n## 2. Create a user interface \nAfter you confirm access to the API by running the code cells, it's time to start work on a basic Web application. For this example, you will create a user interface by using Python Flask. The following techniques can also be applied to other web app frameworks. For this tutorial, a boilerplate Python Flask web app will be created on IBM Cloud and the supporting files will be downloaded.  These files will be updated to integrate with your model and then pushed back up.\n\n1. Start by deploying a Python Flask boilerplate. Sign on to your **IBM Cloud** account and click **Catalog** > **Apps** > **Boilerplates** > **Python Flask**. \n2. In the **App name** field, enter a unique name for your application. This name identifies your application and will appear in the URL that users need to access the app.\n3. Click **Create**. Please give this some time to start.  The web app is running when there is a green dot next to the top title and it says **Running**.  To access this web app, click on the **Visit App URL** link.  The URL to access this Web application will be: `http://<your_app_name>.mybluemix.net` \n3. Download and unpack the command line interface and the starter code shown on this web page.  Please spend some time on this page and become familiar with Cloud Foundry and Python Flask. \n4. Now this boilerplate Python Flask Web application will be updated to call the deployed logistic regression model above. \n5. In the folder where the unpacked starter code is located, create a file called `MLTutorial.py` and copy the following Python code into that file. As before, update the `url`, `username`, `password`, and `scoring_endpoint` fields to match with your deployed model. You may need to set pasting options to preserve the indentations which are critical for the following Python code. When completed, save this file. Note: For detailed information on coding in Flask, please refer to the following Web site: http://flask.pocoo.org \n\n```python\nimport urllib3, requests, json, os\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\nfrom flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap\nfrom flask_wtf import FlaskForm\nfrom wtforms import StringField, SubmitField, RadioField, FloatField, IntegerField\nfrom wtforms.validators import Required, Length, NumberRange\nurl = 'enter_your_wml_instance_url'\nusername = 'enter_your_username'\npassword = 'enter_your_password'\nscoring_endpoint = 'enter_your_online_scoring_end_point'\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secretpassw0rd'\nbootstrap = Bootstrap(app)\nclass TentForm(FlaskForm):\n  Sex = RadioField('Your Gender', coerce=str, choices=[('M','Male'),('F','Female')])\n  Age = FloatField('Your Age', validators=[NumberRange(1,100)])\n  Married = RadioField('Your Marital Status', coerce=str, choices=[('Married','Married'), \\\n    ('Single','Single'),('Unspecified','Unspecified')])\n  Job = RadioField('Your Job', coerce=str, choices=[('Executive', 'Executive'), \\\n    ('Hospitality' ,'Hospitality'),('Other','Other'),('Professional','Professional'), \\\n    ('Retail','Retail'),('Retired','Retired'),('Sales','Sales'),('Student','Student'), \\\n    ('Trades','Trades')])\n  submit = SubmitField('Submit')\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef index():\n  form = TentForm()\n  if form.validate_on_submit():\n    Sex = form.Sex.data\n    form.Sex.data = ''\n    Age = form.Age.data\n    form.Age.data = ''\n    Married = form.Married.data\n    form.Married.data = ''\n    Job = form.Job.data\n    form.Job.data = ''\n    headers = urllib3.util.make_headers(basic_auth='{}:{}'.format(username, password))\n    path = '{}/v3/identity/token'.format(url)\n    response = requests.get(path, headers=headers)\n    mltoken = json.loads(response.text).get('token')\n    scoring_header = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + mltoken}\n    payload = {\"fields\": [\"GENDER\",\"AGE\",\"MARITAL_STATUS\",\"PROFESSION\"], \"values\": [[\"M\",20,\"Single\",\"Student\"]]}\n    scoring = requests.post(scoring_endpoint, json=payload, headers=scoring_header)\n    return render_template('score.html', form=form, scoring=scoring)\n  return render_template('index.html', form=form)\nport = os.getenv('PORT', '5000')\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(port))\n```\n\n\n### Setting up files\n\n1.  Edit the `Procfile` file and replace the contents with the following line of code. \n\n    ```python\n    web: python MLTutorial.py\n    ```\n    This points to the Python code to be executed that was created in the previous step. Save this file. \n\n2.  Add the following lines of code to the `requirements.txt` file. Flask should already be there. Save this file. \n\n    ```python\n    Flask==0.10.1\n    urllib3\n    requests\n    flask_bootstrap\n    flask_wtf\n    ```\n3.  Two template web pages need to be added. Create a sub-folder called `templates`.  In the `templates` folder, create a file called `index.html` and copy the following code into the file. \n\n    ```python\n    {% extends 'bootstrap/base.html' %}\n    {% import \"bootstrap/wtf.html\" as wtf %}\n    {% block title %}Tent Prediction{% endblock %}\n    {% block navbar %}\n        <nav class=\"navbar navbar-inverse\" role=\"navigation\">\n            <div class=\"container\">\n            <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"#\">Tent Prediction</a>\n            </div>\n        </nav>\n    {% endblock %}\n    {% block content %}\n        <div class=\"container\">\n            <form method=\"POST\" action=\"\">\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    <h3>To determine the probability of a tent purchase, please enter the following:</h3>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-md-8\">\n                <p>{{ form.Sex.label }} {{ wtf.form_field(form.Sex) }}</p>\n                <p>{{ form.Age.label }} {{ form.Age(size=2) }}\n                    {% for error in form.Age.errors %}\n                    &nbsp;&nbsp;{{ error }}\n                {% endfor %}</p>\n                <p>{{ form.Married.label }} {{ wtf.form_field(form.Married) }}</p>\n                <p>{{ form.Job.label }} {{ wtf.form_field(form.Job) }}</p>\n                <br>\n                {{ form.submit() }}\n                {{ form.hidden_tag() }}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    {% endblock %}\n    ```\n\n4.  Save this file. \n\n5.  In the `templates` folder, create a file called `score.html` and copy the following lines of code into the file you create. \n\n    ```python\n    {% extends 'bootstrap/base.html' %}\n    {% import \"bootstrap/wtf.html\" as wtf %}\n    {% block title %}Tent Prediction{% endblock %}\n    {% block navbar %}\n        <nav class=\"navbar navbar-inverse\" role=\"navigation\">\n            <div class=\"container\">\n            <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"/\">Tent Prediction</a>\n            </div>\n        </nav>\n    {% endblock %}\n    {% block content %}\n        <div class=\"container\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                    {{ scoring.json() }}\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n                <h4><a href=\"/\">Try Again!</h4>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    {% endblock %}\n    ```\n    \n6.  Save this file.\n\n<a id=\"publish\"></a>\n## Step 3: Publish\n\nYou can now publish this updated web application to IBM Cloud. \n \n1.  Go to the folder where the starter code is located. **Hint**: If you\u2019re in the `templates` folder, move up one folder. \n2.  Type `cf login` and press **Enter**.  You are prompted for your email id.  Type it in and press **Enter**. \n3.  Type your password and press **Enter**. \n4.  If prompted, type the number that corresponds to your organization and press **Enter**.\n5.  Type `cf push` and press **Enter**. If successful, the responses will display the **App started** message and the **OK** status as well as information about the instances and usage.  Please give this some time to complete.\n6.  Once started, point your browser to the web application URL. The URL consists of the name that you used for the app `your_app_name`, inserted into the following URL: http://your_app_name.mybluemix.net  \n7. \tWhen the page renders, make the following selections: For gender, select **Male**; for the age, type **20**; for marital status, select **Single**; and for the profession, select **Student**. \n8.  Click **Submit**. If you see the boilerplate Web page, you must refresh the browser page. \n\nThe web page displays the raw JSON response from the deployed model.  In the JSON are two sets of data, a list of fields and a list of corresponding values.  If you find the value for **probability**, you will see that there is a 19.52% (your result may vary slightly) probability for a tent purchase given a single, 20 year old male that is a student. Note that this is the same value previously observed in the beginning part of this notebook.  To observe probabilities for other variations, click **Try Again!**.  It should be noted that a skilled web developer can take this raw data and present it elegantly.\n\n<a id=\"summary\"></a>\n## 4. Summary and next steps\n\nCongratulations! You have completed this tutorial that demonstrates how a deployed model in IBM Watson Machine Learning can be called in real time for scoring. By using  advanced web application development skills, the user interface can be significantly enhanced and other web app technologies leveraged. \n\n\n## Author\n\n**Daniel Kikuchi** is an Executive IT Specialist and a North America Big Data Technical Sales Specialist in the IBM Analytics organization.
