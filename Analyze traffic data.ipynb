Notebooks can contain live code, static text, equations and visualizations. In this lab, we will walk through how to use PixieDust with Spark and Notebooks to analyze open data around police incidents in San Francisco and then build charts and maps to discover insights. We will then show how to build a dashboard that drills down into specific areas and how to combine multiple data sources like crime or speeding zones to extract even more insights..  \n\n<center>\n![pixiedust](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2017/03/pixiedust200.png)\n<br/>\n</center>\n\n<center>\nLearn more about PixieDust [Here](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/watson-data-platform/pixiedust/)\n</center>\n<center>\nYou may access the complete tutorial with step by step instructions here: [https://www.slideshare.net/DTAIEB/pixie-dust-overview](https://www.slideshare.net/DTAIEB/pixie-dust-overview)  \n  \n</center>\n<br/>\n",

Specifically:\n\n- The `Time` field is a string, so we'll need to add an `Hour` column if we want to see the time of day when most incidents occur, and\n- The `DayOfWeek` values are rendered in alphabetical order by default instead of chronological order, so we should rename them to make it easier to see how the number of incidents changes over the course of the week, and\n- We should condense the outcome types of each police accident if we want to see the most common resolutions of police incidents in each police district, since the clustering above was unclear.\n\nLet's cleanse the data and re-investigate before moving on:\n\n> Note: the next cell is using PySpark APIs to manipulate the data.

Some useful questions to ask at this point are:\n\n### Do certain streets effect on the number of incidents?\n\n### Are there more incidents in areas at the borders of police districts?\n\n### Do police calming devices reduce the number of incidents?\n\nWe can test these hypotheses in two ways:\n\n1) Download datasets for crime data and police calming in San Francisco and simply use the `display` API to visualize crime zones and areas with police calming devices separately.\n\n2) Build a **Pixie App**, which encapsulates everything we have discussed thus far into an interactive way to explore multiple views of the data.\n\nOnly basic HTML and JavaScript are needed to write a Pixie App, so you don't have to learn any new languages or frameworks.  In particular, a Pixie App will allow us to overlay mapping layers, and therefore give us a clearer view into the problem we are investigating.",
